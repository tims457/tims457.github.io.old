Some good discussions on learning and writing worth sharing.


- [How to Understand Things](https://nabeelqu.co/understanding) - On habits to increase understanding and intelligence.

- [Learning how to Learn](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/34-learning) - Tactics and techniques for learning more effectively and making things stick.

- [Learning by Writing](https://www.cold-takes.com/learning-by-writing/) - A method for organizing learning through writing rather than reading by iteratively forming, critiquing, and reforming your view. Reminds me of John Boyd's *Destruction and Creation*.

- [The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) - Most of the resources above are about learning and writing to learn, but this probably isn't the way you want to write professionally. In this lecture, Larry McEnerney discusses the difference between writing professionally and writing to think. He emphasizes the goal of professional writing is not just to convey your ideas, but to change the reader's ideas about a subject.
