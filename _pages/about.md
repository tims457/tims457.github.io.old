I'm an aerospace engineer living in Colorado. I graduated from the US Military Academy at West Point before going on to serve as an aviation officer and UH-60M Blackhawk pilot. I left the military in 2018 and attended graduate school at the University of Colorado Boulder graduating with an MS in Aerospace Engineering. Outside of engineering, I enjoy hiking, trail running (including the occasional ultramarathon), biking, and climbing.
