## learning / thinking about
- reinforcement learning algorithms
    - planning / model predictive control
    - [denoising autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11981)
- probabilistic programing
    - Pyro, PyMC3, TensorFlow Probability

## working on
- model-based reinforcement learning similar to [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00374).
